Annotation refinement

Please use the command line to generate job scripts: 

sh gen_bench_job_scripts.sh  <output script path> <Vaa3D executable folder path> <input folder path> <input swc name> <output folder path> <terafly 3rd highest resolution folder> <terafly highest resolution folder>

<output script path>:  output job script path (*.sh) 
<Vaa3D executable folder path>: the pre-built Vaa3D folder
<input folder path>: the input swc file's folder
<input swc name>: the input swc file  
<output folder path>: the output folder which is used to save the refined results
<terafly 3rd highest resolution folder>: the 3rd (4x4x4 downsample) highest resolution folder
<terafly highest resolution folder>: the full resolution folder

here is one example to generate all job scripts for all swc files under /home/user/zhi/annotations/17302 folder
cd /home/user/zhi/annotations/17302
for filename in `ls *swc`
do
	sh /home/user/zhi/scripts/gen_bench_job_scripts.sh /home/user/zhi/qsub_files/17302/${filename}.sh /home/user/zhi/vaa3d /home/user/zhi/annotations/17302 $filename /home/user/zhi/refinement/17302 '/PBshare/TeraconvertedBrain/mouse17302_teraconvert/RES(13650x8603x2461)' '/PBshare/TeraconvertedBrain/mouse17302_teraconvert/RES(54600x34412x9847)' 
					
done

And then use "qsub" to submit all jobs in /home/user/zhi/qsub_files/17302/ folder. All results will be saved in /home/user/zhi/refinement/17302 folder.
